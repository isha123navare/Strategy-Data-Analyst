Data Cleaning:
1.First convert the data to a table for easy visualization and understanding.
2.Using COUNTBLANK function in excel, calculated the amount of blanks in each column. 

Result:
Column Name	        No. of Blanks
Engine Fuel Type	      3
Engine HP	              69
Engine Cylinders	      30
Number of Doors	        6

Other columns do not have any missing/null values or blanks.

3.	Determining method to handle missing values:

Column Name	     No. of Blanks	Method of Handling Data	   Skewness	 Kurtosis	 Median
Engine Fuel Type	3	              Delete Rows	               NA	        NA	      NA
Engine HP	       69	            Median Imputation	       1.291229	     2.323	    227
Engine Cylinders 30	            Median Imputation	       0.964542	       2	       6
Number of Doors	  6	              Delete Rows	               NA	        NA	      NA

Reasoning: 
A.	Some rows would be deleted as they are lesser in number.
B.	Median Imputation is chosen for the dataset as the distribution of Engine HP & Engine Cylinders is positively skewed.
